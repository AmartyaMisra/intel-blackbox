# Phishing Kits & Infrastructure Rentals: The Service Economy of Deception

> *“Cybercrime has evolved beyond hacking—it’s customer service for fraud.”*

---

## 🎯 Introduction

Modern phishing is no longer a handcrafted con. It’s a **plug-and-play industry**, where attackers can rent an entire infrastructure—**kits, hosting, proxies, SMS gateways**—and launch campaigns with zero technical knowledge.

Welcome to the **Phishing-as-a-Service (PhaaS)** economy. Think of it as Shopify for scams.

## 🧱 What is a Phishing Kit?

A **phishing kit** is a pre-packaged bundle containing everything needed to imitate a target (e.g., bank, social media, e-commerce):

* HTML/CSS templates of fake login pages
* JavaScript keyloggers
* Redirection and error pages
* SMTP scripts to send bait emails
* Admin panel to capture credentials in real time

> Many kits even include **anti-bot filters** to avoid detection by scanners.

## 🧬 Real-World Example: India

> **Fake SBI Login Campaign (2023)**

* Telegram group rented a full SBI phishing kit

* Kit included dynamic OTP field to trick 2FA users
* Hosted on a hacked university subdomain

Result: over ₹25L siphoned before takedown

* **Geo-fencing**: Show page only in target country
* **IP whitelisting**: Panel only visible to attacker

Some kits even allow **victim device fingerprinting** for targeted payloads.

* GitHub (yes—often briefly hosted before takedown)
