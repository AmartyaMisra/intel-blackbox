## 🛰️ What is a Satellite?

A **satellite** is any object placed into orbit around a planet. While the Moon is Earth’s natural satellite, most satellites are **human-made machines** designed to perform specific tasks like communication, imaging, navigation, weather monitoring, or reconnaissance.

Over 6,000 satellites currently orbit Earth. Some are no bigger than a shoebox (CubeSats); others weigh several tons.

## 🧭 Types of Satellites by Orbit

### 🚀 1. **LEO (Low Earth Orbit)**

* Altitude: 160–2,000 km
* Used for: Imaging, spying, Starlink internet, ISS
* Pros: Low latency, high resolution
* Cons: Short orbital period, need many for coverage

### 🌐 2. **MEO (Medium Earth Orbit)**

* Altitude: 2,000–35,000 km
* Used for: GPS, navigation satellites

### 🌍 3. **GEO (Geostationary Orbit)**

* Altitude: \~35,786 km
* Used for: Weather, TV broadcast, military comms
* Always stays over the same Earth point

> **Fun fact**: GEO satellites orbit the Earth once every 24 hours—matching Earth's rotation.

## 🔧 Core Components of a Satellite

1. **Power System**: Solar panels + batteries
2. **Communication Antennas**: Transmit/receive data
3. **Payload**: Cameras, sensors, signal processors
4. **Thermal Control**: Insulation, radiators
5. **Propulsion System**: Thrusters to maintain orbit
6. **Onboard Computer**: Controls operations

---

## 📡 Communication Flow

1. Satellite receives signals from Earth (uplink)
2. Processes or relays signal internally
3. Sends signal back to another location (downlink)
4. Earth station receives, processes, and distributes data

## 🛠️ How Satellites Stay in Orbit

Satellites are in **free fall**, but their sideways velocity ensures they **keep missing Earth**. Gravity pulls them down while they travel forward—creating a stable orbit.

Formula: `Centripetal force = Gravitational pull`

> Too slow = crash. Too fast = escape Earth’s gravity.

## 🧠 Real-World Use Cases

* **GPS**: Triangulation from MEO satellites
* **Weather**: IMD, NOAA satellites detect storms
* **Spy Sats**: India’s RISAT, US NRO birds
* **TV & Internet**: Dish TV, Starlink, VSAT terminals
* **Disaster Response**: Forest fire, flood mapping
* **Signals Intelligence**: Capturing RF emissions

## 🛰️ Satellite Constellations

Large coordinated swarms of satellites:

* **Starlink**: SpaceX broadband internet (4,000+ active)
* **OneWeb**: Competing global ISP constellation
* **Galileo/NavIC/GLONASS**: GPS alternatives

---

## 🔐 Risks & Warfare Tactics

* **Jamming**: Block satellite signals (RF denial)
* **Spoofing**: Send fake signals (GPS manipulation)
* **ASAT Weapons**: Anti-satellite missiles (China, India, US)
* **Kinetic Kill**: Debris-generating satellite attacks
* **Cyber-Hijacking**: Take control of a satellite remotely

> In 2022, Russia allegedly jammed Starlink over Ukraine; SpaceX responded with rapid firmware updates.

## 🇮🇳 India’s Satellite Ecosystem

* Managed by **ISRO**, **DRDO**, and private players
* Key satellites:

  * **CartoSat**: High-res imaging
  * **GSAT**: Communication
  * **IRNSS/NavIC**: India’s GPS system
  * **RISAT**: All-weather radar spy

Launch centers: **Sriharikota (SHAR)**
