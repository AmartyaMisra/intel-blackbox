## 🎯 What Is Meme Warfare?

Meme warfare is the **strategic use of memes to shape perception, manipulate sentiment, and influence behavior**—often in political, ideological, or military contexts. It’s the **information-age equivalent of leaflets from the sky**, but far more viral, visual, and visceral.

## 🧠 Why Memes Work

* Fast processing by the brain (images + minimal text)
* Emotional, not rational
* Shareable across demographics
* Humor disarms critical thinking
* Hard to trace or censor without backlash
